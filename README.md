# Stability of precition stage

Thermal compensation and in positon stability


Due to variaus reasons inspection stages are showcase position error and motion after stop command.

### Tests conducted 

1. XY stage positon variation anlysis in variable temparature.
    "Files used": test6
    Dataset captured: 
2. Granite positon variation 


To do multiple tests multiple programs were created. 
List for programs and
